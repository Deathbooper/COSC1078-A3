    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>Roles:</h1>
      <p>We have not defined any specific roles for each group member. The way that our group has decided to assign roles would be that in the first week of the assignment we would assign specific tasks to each group member that they would need to complete. We have attempted to evenly spread these tasks among group members so that each group member will have an equal contribution.</p>  
      <p>These tasks assigned to each group member may not be all part of the same category such needing to design the UI of the app and writing up part of the report, therefore no specific roles can be assigned to each group member. This therefore allows more freedom for group members to choose what tasks they want to be responsible for completing as the tasks can cover a range of areas rather than just one specific role. The assignment of specific tasks and responsibilities instead of broad roles like “Technical Designer” lets each group member know exactly what tasks they need to complete and when they need to complete them so that there is no room for confusion of who does what.</p>  
      <p>We use a Trello board to set out all the tasks that need to be completed and it lets other group member to know what tasks each group member is working on or has completed so that if a group member needs to wait for the completion of another task by another group member before completing their task, they can check Trello for progression before inquiring about it with that group member.</p>  
      <p>On the Trello board we placed tasks into the to do section for task that still need completing, we placed tasks in the doing section for tasks that we were currently working on, and we placed tasks in the done section for tasks that have the writing completed. There is also an editing and compile/finished section for tasks that are being proofread and improved.</p> 
      <p>We used different colours on each task to represent which group member/s are responsible for completing that task. Henry was green and was responsible for the project description, aim, plans and creating the Trello board. Adrian was red and was responsible for group processes, career plans and ideal jobs comparison, roles and the wireframes along with the Figma mockup. Lachlan was blue and was responsible for plans, group processes and communications, timeframe and website. Ryan was purple and was responsible for overview, risks, skills and jobs, final report and summary group reflection. Heath was yellow and was responsible for the tools section, scope and limits and website along with skills and jobs. Shiou-ping was orange and was responsible for the website, skills and jobs section and the tools and technology section.</p>  
      <p>For tasks that all group members needed to do were given a dark blue colour. These tasks were team profile, testing, progress, timeframe, app creation, group reflection and Spark Plus.</p>
