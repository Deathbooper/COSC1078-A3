  <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>The project is an AR map that will assist RMIT students and staff to find their way around RMIT buildings. The project has been named MARPS (Multiple Augmented Reality Path Services). MARPS will allow for faster map reading and reduce travel time to classes.</p>
    <p>MARPS is an app that allows RMIT students to easily find their classes in their buildings through an app that includes an augmented reality displayed on an iPhone/android. This project will allow students and staff to view a path to their room on their mobile devices. The path would be displayed in a clear manner, and it will be able to direct students and teachers quickly and easily. E.g., if a student cannot find room 42 in building 12 then the app will direct a path from wherever they are standing to the selected room. Through this app, it will dramatically decrease the confusion for students trying to find new rooms/ lecture theatres as it will be on a map like google maps street view.</p>
    <p>The motivation to produce MARPS is because as new students we all found it hard to find our rooms and buildings for the first week of our studyâ€™s. Because of this we came up with the idea of an application that can easily direct users better than the current RMIT navigation system.</p>
    <p>Unlike other AR Maps, MARPS will be unique to RMIT and will feature an easy to understand and learn interface for new users. In order to make this a successful application there is a set of criteria which should be met, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display the location to at least 1 room in a building from within a set area</li>
      <li>Be easy to understand and use</li>
      <li>Successfully arrive at a specified room</li>
      <li>Successfully arrive at a specified room</li>
      <li>Show emergency escape routes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At MARPS core it will be based of a unity SDK made by ARWAY, this SDK will allow for the development of the scan on an online space. The details to how this process works from a scan to complete application is listed below.</p>
    <p>Once this set of criteria is met there are further opportunities that could be explored if we have more time. Opportunities could include tracking users when they use the app and use their cameras to live update the online environment. This would allow for the tracking to stay up to date with little to no need to monitor it.</p>
    <p>Our budget for the project is $0 as we want to use free programs to save money. However, this comes with limitations, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Member Availabilty</li>
      <li>Ethics</li>
      <li>Laws</li>
      <li>Money</li>
    </ul>
