            <h1>Skills and Job</h1>
            <p>Should we have the ability to hire four workers to help us build this project all the way along to completion we first have to consider what needs to be done to complete the project. As the project is based on AR, a 3D artist or 3D visualiser would be a good fit for the job as they would be able to create a range of 3D assets that would be used to show to the user, like an arrow on the ground showing them to their destination. Another profession that would be well suited to one of the jobs we have to fill would be a programmer, someone to ‘stitch’ all of the inputs to produce quality outputs alongside the assets that the 3D artist has created, things like being able to create a program that would be able to create real time 3D renderings of the environment and then find where it must go and place the directions on the display in the correct place. A UI designer would be able to create a good-looking and ergonomic interface for the program, not only the buttons that must be selected to use the program but also how everything gets placed on the screen to create a highly useable and pleasing experience for the users. As with all programs, there will be errors and bugs that are mostly hidden, this is where a tester would come in and uncover as many bugs within the programming as possible, doing whatever they can to improve the user experience by eliminating unwanted errors.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>3D Artist</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Ability to produce high-quality renders for use in the program, working with the UI designer to ensure that the models are being created for proper implementation in the program, basically the 3D artist needs to make what the UI designer wants to be in the program to make it look nice and be useable. Communication with other colleagues.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
                <p>Experience with the following programs: Studio Max, blender, Corona rendering engine and have experience in Photoshop. Experience with animation along with related software such as GrowFX, Forest Pack, RailClone, Marvelous Designer, Unity/Unreal Engine, Deadline, SketchUp, InDesign and After Effects would also be a benefit to creating the project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Programmer</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Design of software to meet functional and technical requirements, including both the UI designer’s vision of the program and the 3D artists creations being considered throughout the programming creation. The programmer must also participate in some developer testing and attempt to reduce as many bugs as possible. Communication with other colleagues.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
                <p>Coding experience with C+/#, python, java, experience in software testing and proper software principles and practices.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>UI designer</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Although it's the software developers' job to make our app work, we also need it to look good, or at least meet the industry standard, for this we plan to employ UI/UX designers. They're responsible for wireframe drafting and visual prototyping, they will work with the software developer team to direct the code structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
                <p>We expected them to have experience in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create UI element like bars and buttons and be able to use tools such as InVision for storyboard creation.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Tester</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>To ensure the final product works as intended, a dedicated tester is essential to ensure our application works as the people who created it envisioned. This can be broken down to both code block unit testing and function testing where tester will undergo a field test in user environment. Communication with other colleagues.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
                <p>They should have knowledge of programming like software development, but more so focusing on CI/CD aspect. Using tools like CircleCI to set a build test pipeline to ensure that every small integration does not break the code. For more complex testing like identification and navigation, they'll try out our test build on field, and provide feedback to our developing team.</p>

            <h2>Common traits</h2>
            <p>Each role or position described previously as potential job listings for our project, share a common requirement of qualities and traits to develop a successful team and working environment. These traits are fairly spread out but are essential for an effective group to work on the project. A key trait which must be instilled within everyone is the ability to communicate & work in a team. For example, the 3D artist may need to collaborate with the UI designer for certain aspects of the prototype and design of the final application. However, if individuals do not discuss their work or struggles then the opportunity for miscommunication arises, hindering the overall goal of the project as certain aspects of the project may not be covered or completed up to a required standard, possibly making this trait the most important. Another essential trait for all jobs would be problem solving skills, including creativity and innovation so that any issues or problems that arise can be solved in an efficient manner for the betterment of the entire team. As an example, one more trait which would be considered a prerequisite could be organisational skills, this is another main trait required by all members of the project so that any goals or aims which need to be achieved can be done so on time. The progression needs to be in sync and meeting deadlines, otherwise the project may never be completed. These are just a few of the many traits which should be possessed by members of the team in order to achieve the successful creation and end goal of our project. </p>
