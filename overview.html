        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <h2>Topic</h2>
        <p>With this project, we as a group have the common goal of creating an easy-to-use application, specifically an AR (Augmented Reality) navigation tool, to assist our fellow RMIT peers, lecturers, tutors and frankly anyone that visits the RMIT City Campus to find their way around. The RMIT Campus for most people can be quite daunting initially, considering the numerous buildings, levels and rooms. Therefore, our idea to develop this mobile application involves implementing a sense of ease to those who may be confused when it comes to navigating the campus.</p>
        <p>The application will be directed towards mobile devices, displaying a path from any given location on campus to any other location on campus, which is done through 3-Dimensional spatial scanning. The application should be able to highlight the essentials around campus, such as exits, toilets, elevators and any structural or temporary blocks. The application also aims to replace any maps of the RMIT campus, through the class searching system. However, our end goal involves being able to travel to and from campus to nearby locations for transport as well, which could be achieved within appropriate time constraints.</p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Our collective motivation to pursue this project stems from the struggles we encountered as new students enrolled to the RMIT City Campus when we were trying to locate our rooms. Therefore, we wish to create an application hoping to alleviate these issues for any other newcomers to the campus. As an example, our group can speak from experience, now that we understand where our scheduled classrooms are, we can agree that it took some time for us to have a clear grasp on how to get to our rooms effectively. In addition to this, we still only understand where the basics are located, such as the library and our few allocated rooms. Furthermore, if we have a room change for example, it would likely be an extended and unnecessary amount of time to locate the room. That is why we feel that our project idea is of great importance, as it can eliminate this issue for years to come.</p>
        <p>AR technology has rapidly increased in usage since it was first developed around 25 years ago. The adaptations and innovation to AR technology in recent years creates a seemingly infinite number of possibilities in terms of what can be achieved. To be able to successfully create an application utilising this recent technology would be an amazing learning opportunity but also a nice boost on our resumes for any future endeavours. This project would also demonstrate to future employers our abilities to work in a team effectively, to keep up with current trends, to tackle our daily issues head on and our ability to delegate responsibilities.</p>
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
        <p>Since our design is only relevant to the RMIT City Campus, there are no real competitors in this market or intended area. Some examples which are similar include the RMIT Map and essentially Google Maps. However, these are both limiting, the RMIT map can tell you where the buildings are, but it doesn’t include how to access the building and travel to or locate specific rooms on different levels. This map is also not very interactive and can only provide a limited navigation of the campus. The next biggest competitor would be Google Maps, as if you search up an RMIT building it will tell you how to get to the building and can provide a live 360 view with virtual directions, similar to our application. However, again this is limited as it doesn’t provide how to enter the building or any directions within the building. This is precisely how our application prevails, it provides navigation from the street view, but can also show you the pinpoint location of a room within the building, with virtual directions on how to get there. This will be provided on the application through lines on the mobile phone view of the building, accessed through the phone’s camera, directing an individual to their required destination.</p>
