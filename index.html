Main interests in IT (Information Technology) would be Cybersecurity, software development and game development. Interested in the protection of data from cyber attackers through software aspect of Cybersecurity. Interested in the programming and development aspect of software development. Interested in the level of freedom provided by game creation software along with development of physics and lighting engines for games.

        <p><b>Group member 2: Heath Yates (s3942349) </b> </p>
        <p>Part two of the Clappers. I was born in Warrnambool and lived there until I was 18, I am still 18 but now I live in Melbourne so that I can study at RMIT. My ancestors were from Ireland and England but in recent history they are all Australian so therefore I am Australian too. Did years 12 twice, only speak English, used to play hockey and I am into cars. My interest in IT stems from wanting to make software that people will enjoy using. </p>
        <p><b>Group member 3: Lachlan Casey (s3721527)</b></p>
        <p>Born and raised here in Melbourne, I finished high school in 2017 and worked for a bit before coming to study at RMIT. My hobbies primarily revolve around the fantasy genre, whether that be with computer games or tabletop games. My interest in IT stems from when I built my first computer at 15, which then led to a general interest in technology and what it could do. My previous IT experience is mainly a VCE IT course, as well as a bit of hobby work with my friends and I’s computers. Currently working as part of the Clappers. </p>
        <p><b>Group member 4: Shiou-Ping Chu (s3734303) </b></p>
        <p>International student from Taiwan after some failed attempted in academic and came here for one last chance of redemption. Originally enrolled to software engineering, but unable to find an internship and failed on AI and computing theory, so I was cast down to Information technology. My goal is just finding a job in IT field and have a roof on my top, however fulfilling such vision while stay in Australia seems rather unlikely </p>
        <p><b>Group member 5: Henry Norman (s3953843) </b></p>
        <p>I grew up on a farm in rural Northeast Victoria near, Albury/Wodonga outside a town called Rutherglen. I am the youngest out of my siblings, I have two older brothers that are currently studying tertiary studies. I was born in Australia. I have a wide range of hobbies, some of which include Playing video games, shooting and 4x4ing, I also have a strong interest in most things to do with technology and computers. I love going shooting, specifically clay targets and biathlon, to which I held champion for several years. I also enjoy 4x4ing and hiking. My greatest hiking achievement and claim to fame was completing ‘The Overland track’ in a blizzard. During my studies through high school, I took up a casual job at Buller Wines to which I would often work holidays and some public holidays at, it was here where I picked up a strong work ethic. I chose an IT degree because I take a heavy interest in technology and want to learn application development, learn cybersecurity and pick up a degree that will help me into suitable jobs related to software development. I have no formal experience with IT only self-learned unity and Vex programming. </p>
        <p><b>Group member 6: Ryan Fernandes (s3947718) </b></p>
        <p>Firstly, I am a team member of the clappers. I am a first-year university student at RMIT, completing year 12 last year in 2021. I am one of three siblings within the Fernandes Family, I have an older brother Roy and a younger sister named Rhea, making me the middle child. My parents, Richard and Philomena are originally from India, making my nationality Indian as well, we are specifically from the South-West of India, in the city known as Mangalore in Karnataka. I have been in Melbourne my entire life, as I was born in Carlton in 2003 and haven’t lived anywhere outside Victoria. I can speak fluent English and some Konkani while I can understand Hindi, Konkani and English. My hobbies include basketball, either playing or watching, I simply cannot get enough of it. To be honest when I am not busy with work or Uni, I am probably watching an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. My other passion is music, I love making and listening to music, especially the ‘rap’ genre. I have many favorite artists, including J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. I also rap on the side whenever I have the time to, which I have a couple of songs, but they are still a work in progress. </p>
