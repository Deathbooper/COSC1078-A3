          <h3>Adrian</h3>
          <p>After experiencing the assignment 2 problems we learnt the importance of communication and delegation of tasks before beginning work. We gave Ryan an ultimatum in the first week for him to prove that he is reliable and will do work by completing work by a certain deadline. He managed to complete the work on time, so he remained in the group. In the first week the group put their heads down, placing extra stress on giving each group member tasks to complete for each week. We delegated each group member tasks to complete and put them on a Trello board so that each group member can keep track of what each member is doing or has completed. We tried to ensure that every member had equal contribution regarding the tasks they are responsible for completing. In the first three weeks we managed to get most of the writing tasks completed. Some things that could be improved would be the contribution of certain group members. We had some problems with Shiou-Ping and his contribution of work. Though we eventually sorted this by bugging him to complete his work and contacting Anthony about it so that he could give him a push. Some other things that could be improved would be that towards the end of week 3 there were a few group members that did not have much to do since they had completed their writing parts and the group members working on the project research didn’t require any extra assistance. To improve this, we could split the project research into more parts so that it can be spread among more group members. There were also some miscommunications with Shiou-Ping who did some work that was unnecessary such as rewriting the Skills and Jobs section when he was only responsible for a single job. To improve we would need to be clearer with him with his tasks to make sure he understands. One thing what was surprising about the project was how the tools we had planned to use for the application were removed while we were doing the project which put a damper on our proceedings with the project. One thing about groups that came up during the project would be that when there are so many group members sometimes it can be difficult to make sure each member always has something to do.

              start and constant stream of work to be produced by most group members. Ryan was told at the start of the assignment that if he was to not start contributing more to the group then he would be removed from the group, thankfully he began to produce enough satisfactory work and stayed on the team. Shiou-Ping has a similar situation about halfway through the project, and he also managed to up his contribution. Lauchlan and Henry both worked very well on the more practical parts of the assignment, eventually creating a satisfactory product. Both me and Adrain worked more so on the writing component, I would say I did alright, but I will let the others talk about me, Adrain did a fantastic job getting us started and also produced a large amount of good quality written work. Our group had a rough start coming out of assignment 2 but through a little bit of negative reinforcement the group managed to end very strong with everyone doing good work and helping to finish off this assignment.

              As we began this assessment, there were a couple of things that needed to be addressed immediately, namely the lack of work from some group members. Thankfully we were able to mostly resolve this issue through being firm and giving a couple of ultimatums. From there we were able to progress through this assessment well, though it was not without its headaches. The mapping app we were planning to make heavy use of was taken down whilst we were doing the report writing segment, which kneecapped us a little once we began producing the project. Our group worked together reasonably well during this assessment, though there were a couple of times where we had to have words with group members and push them to get work done. I think this is partially due to us learning from the last assessment and dividing up work immediately, as well as being more aware as to what to do if a member doesn’t submit work on time. I found that regular meeting attendance played a key role in keeping us organised as well as allowing us to raise concerns to the group when necessary. These meetings were pivotal in keeping on top of everyone’s work progress, as well as giving us a way to directly address any issues with specific group members when needed.

          <h3>Shiou-ping</h3>
          <p>I would admit I wasn't able to actively ask for role especially at the begin where everything was slow paced and somewhat sluggish, this result me in early stage only got some minor roles like writing technology and tools and a small section in skill and job section. Although I was going to write the whole paragraph originally (I think), but I had a hard time to interpret on how I should write it (since it’s said I should take inspiration from job advertisement I assume it was supposed to look job post from LinkedIn, probably some communication issue I should work on it. Otherwise at least I get to create the web page to make it looks better. Also at the very end I found out there was quite a difference between the tools we theorized to use and the tools we actually using are vastly different, and it didn't mention software we manly used like magicplan, and I have to spend some time patch up the paragraph. Overall, I think doing AR application would be too complex and ambitious even if we don’t have to code the actual project but in the end our team able to hand out a rather polished prototype and concept and I would say it’s good enough. What I leaned is if I really need a meaningful teamwork, I must actively demand for work.

          <p>After completing assignment 2, clear issues were noted in relation to contribution and overall effort. I feel that we hit the ground running from the start of assignment 3 very well as we have work split up from the very first lesson. This proves that we have learnt from assignment 2, with members not achieving their full potential and ‘pulling their weight’. I also believe that the assigned workload was much more evenly split between all group members, as everyone had the chance to do more work. However, I believe that a change would have to be made for how work is done so that group members know clearly what they have to do and what they can do as ‘extra’. Through doing this it would stop members being in a ‘stasis’ and be able to always be working on the assignment actively. I was surprised how Ryan endured to ensure he was keeping up with his workload. After working in a group for the past 2 assignments I have come to learn that it is very important to be extremely clear about what people must do and what they can't do, because it is hard to get members back on track when they have no idea what is going on.

          <p>For assignment three I feel as if our team overall worked well. With MS Teams as our only means of communication we still managed to co-operate in an efficient manner. Towards the beginning of the assignment, I was told that I needed to pull more weight in terms of the workload and communication within our team. I managed to complete all my tasks and attend every meeting for this assignment, so I feel as if I did accomplish what I set out to do. The truth is that I was surprised with the high-quality work we produced when we all put our heads together and completed our tasks. This was achieved due to everyone being available and managed properly, which was a big difference from this assignment and assignment two. Even though we did still experience some difficulties with certain group members, we coped with our issues and overcame them by communicating and delegating tasks even further. We always ensured that everyone was on track to meet the soft deadlines, which was an essential aspect of our success within this assignment. However, I do feel that some aspects of our work in this assignment could have been improved, such as delegating tasks based on the amount of work required instead of by the number of tasks. This made certain parts of the workload imbalanced in my opinion. Something I learned about groups with this assignment is that in order to have a successfully functioning group, every member is required to be responsible and accountable for their role and work within the group alongside healthy communication of any information or issues.  </p>
