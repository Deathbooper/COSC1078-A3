      <h1>Testing:</h1>
      <h2>Floorplan Scan Tools</h2>
      <p>A group member recommended RoomScan LiDAR for getting floor plans for the ARWAY app as it is required floor plans for pathfinding. The app was supposed to scan rooms and use machine learning with LiDAR scanning to measure and place symbols that can represent doors, windows, symbols on floor plans created from scratch. However, for proper compatibility with the app, an iPhone 12 pro was required, and the group member who was supposed to use the app did not have an iPhone 12 pro, so they needed to scan the rooms manually. After creating a room scan for the first time and attempting to create another room scan there was a pop up that prevented usage until there was payment made so the group was unable to use the application for scanning further floor plans.</p> 
      <p>Similar apps were tested afterwards, these being Roomscan Pro and Polycam LiDAR and 3D Scanner, but these suffered from the same issue of requesting a quite pricey subscription for use. Eventually an application was found that had a proper free version, and not just a one-off test. The Magicplan app allows users to create up to two projects on its free version, which suits our purposes for this testing phase. It functions by using the user’s phone camera to place points in the corners of rooms to build a floor plan, then the user sets the height of the room, then finally places objects such as doors and furniture. From this the application creates a 3D object that can be exported as an .obj file, for use in Unity.</p>
      <h2>ARWAY</h2>
      <p>ARWAY proved to be quite a time sink when it came to map creation and testing, and currently we are unable to test whether the navigation aspect of the map is implemented correctly as we do not have an application to connect to it with. The intended outcome of the map aspect of ARWAY is that a user will be able to connect to the map from their application, which will then pull the camera feed from their phone and locate them within the mapped area, then guide them to their selected waypoint. Our maps currently have navigation paths, waypoints and several key features of the area, but we do not currently have a method to test its functionality. ARWAY’s developer documentation unfortunately does not make it overly clear as to how to actually create an application to connect to the map, so once we have learnt how to create this application, we will be able to conduct some proper testing of our maps. If our maps as they currently are do not function properly, the web suite allows for maps to be updated live, so this should allow for needed changes to be rolled out rapidly. We will know we have succeeded with our maps when they are able to successfully identify the location of the user within the RMIT Building 8 Floor 8 area and navigate them to room 82. Once this has been achieved, we can then expand to the rest of the floor, and then move further from there.</p>
      <h2>Figma</h2>
      <p>The group looked at ways to represent the prototype for the app regarding UI and UX. The group came across a website called Figma which is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool. This website allowed the creation of a mockup mobile app for iOS that allowed real-time viewing and UI operation of the app. Due to previous experience with Figma from the group’s UCD course which also had them design and develop and app, Figma was the first choice for prototyping an app UI.</p>  
      <p>A group member who was responsible for creating the Figma mockup created multiple pages with the layout and dimensions of an iPhone 13 pro max to use as a template for the MARPS application. They then created a splash screen for the application using time delayed transitions to mimic a conventional mobile application.</p>
      <p>As the MARPS application was specifically for navigating through RMIT using AR technology it was important to include a login screen so that only authorized personnel would be able to use the app to navigate RMIT.</p>
      <p>A menu was created which contained three clickable buttons each of which represented a specific feature of the app such as AR room finder, AR emergency exit finder and an AR room finder for disabled people. Through using the built-in wireframes in Figma they linked each of these buttons to separate pages. In the AR room finder and AR disabled room finder page entry boxes were placed for users to input their desired building, floor and room. In the emergency exit finder, the user would be able to input their building and floor.</p>
      <p>Each of these input pages had a navigate button placed at the button which would be linked to the AR display page which had a gif concept of how the user would navigate using the application to find either a room or emergency exit. Back buttons were also placed on each page to allow users to go back to previous pages.</p>
