        <h1>Group processes</h1>
        <h2>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3? </h2>
        <p>Overall, our group worked quite well in Assignment 2 as we were able to complete the final report and website and submit by the due date. The first and second week of the assignment had minimal developments but once tasks were properly delegated to each group member and each group member knew what to do, most of them were able to pick up the slack and complete their work. However, the workload was not evenly spread throughout the group as certain members needed to help other members complete their work with some not doing much work at all. The led to an increase in stress for those members who had to crunch to get the assignment in on time. Another aspect that the group had significant problems with due to certain group members was a lack of communication. With regards to getting an interview, we had a group member volunteer to get an IT professional for an interview and thus we put our trust in this group member to provide the time that we could conduct an interview with their IT professional. This interview was supposed occur on the Monday on the final week of assignment 2, but our group member was unable to get a time for an interview. This would have been okay if the group member had informed us that they were having a hard time with getting an interview but there was no message of such. The stress of not knowing what was going on with the interview led to stress being placed on the other group members. Luckily on such short notice another group member was able to secure a time for an interview and was conducted the next day. Only the day after the interview would the group member leave a message that they were still trying to get an interview time. In addition to this, there was significant pestering that needed to occur for that group member to do the bare minimum work which was stressful for the other group members and their lack of attendance in the group meetings was leading to a further breakdown of communication. Another group member had been struggling completing their IT technology but failed to inform the other group members and instead brushed off the fact that they had been struggling when asked about it. Only when they were pestered on the Thursday would they reveal that they needed assistance with their part. This has led to a decrease in trust of these group members to complete their work and other group members will be keeping an eye on their progression throughout assignment 3.

            In assignment 3 some changes will be introduced about the delegation of work. Clear tasks and outcomes will be set for each group member to complete so that no group member will feel lost or have nothing to do. Through this initial delegation, the group would try to assign equal amounts of work to each group member to avoid a situation similar to assignment 2. This will be done through Trello where group members will be indicating which tasks that they are working on or have completed. Due dates will be set for each task which would put some needed pressure on certain group members to start doing their work. The timeframe section of the assignment 3 should help with the setting of due date as it would specify which group members are doing which work on a given week and the progress section allowing group members to record their progress which regards to their given tasks. The importance of meetings has been stressed and other group members have discussed with the mostly absent group member about their attendance of meetings, and they have said that they try harder to attend the meetings or send a message in advance for as the reason for their absence rather than radio silence like before. This should strengthen communication between group members.
