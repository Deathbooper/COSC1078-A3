    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>Risks:</h1>
      <p>Possible risks that could pose a threat to the completion of our assignment include software issues. Since our project encompasses an AI tool to navigate the RMIT campus, most aspects that could go wrong are software related. The software we use for 3D mapping is ‘Unity’ and ARWAY, which are cross platform game engines that can enable users to convert their environment into a 3D map on their device.</p>
      <h2>Unity Risks:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are many risks involved with this, an example being importing and exporting files or visual information into and out of Unity. This could be the downfall of our project as if the prototypes and designs we create are not accurate or up to the standard we want then the project may not accomplish what it set out to do. This would be a serious risk to our project as Unity is one of the only free software services, we could find that suits the needs of our project idea.</li>
        <li>Another risk is that if the software Unity does not have the tools and features required to generate the AI application we desire, since there aren’t many alternatives. One more risk associated with Unity which has been experienced by various users is the fact that running a design sometimes malfunctions completely, however we will have to test this for ourselves.</li>
        <li>Another risk may arise through wireframing, when it comes to utilising Figma certain things can also go wrong. It can be difficult to bring a vision alive on a prototyping tool when not everyone on a team is familiar with the features or when certain features required to achieve an aesthetic are simply not there.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>ARWAY Risks:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A crucial risk involved with the employment of the ARWAY mapping app is its unavailability since we commenced our design process for the project. It has been taken down and is not currently accessible to the public.</li>
        <li>The further risk that this poses is the limited apparent tools available with the use of a Web Suite for mapping.</li>
        <li>Documentation is not as clear as we would like it to be.</li>
        <li>Requires more knowledge of Unity as documentation is also lacking in this aspect.</li>
      </ul>
