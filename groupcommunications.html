    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>

      <h1>Group Processes and Communications:</h1>
      <h2>Beginning of Project:</h2>
      <p>Our group will primarily communicate over Microsoft Teams, making use of their meeting feature, group messaging and shared document system. This allows us to easily meet and speak over voice/video call a minimum of twice a week, with more meetings being scheduled if needed. The group messaging also allows us to easily communicate over text, if need be, when only a single group member needs to be informed of something, or if a small reminder or clarification is needed for the whole group. Additionally, the shared document system allows us to work on the same document simultaneously, for when coordination is needed by multiple group members working on the same section. Our group also aims to have regular attendance at the scheduled tutorials on Thursday afternoon, though this is less vital than Teams meetings as a voice/video call is easier to attend than an in-person meeting. Our group has also set in place the expectation that if a member is unable to attend a meeting for any reason, they should inform the group beforehand, so that the group is not left waiting for them to arrive before beginning.</p>
      <p>As we have had some previous difficulties regarding communication during assignment 2, we have been stricter in our expectations from the start of this assessment, setting in place some firm requirements. Primarily, attendance of meetings and tutorials is expected from all members, unless the group is informed of your absence prior to the meeting. Additionally, if the group has attempted to communicate with a member and they have not responded after a reasonable time period, a 24-hour period for example, then a meeting will be held by the other group members to discuss what should be done. If communication issues are still an issue after a group member has been warned, then the group will get a tutor involved and discuss how to proceed. We have already had to do this once after assessment 2, so it is unlikely this will be required, however the standard remains in place for the worst-case scenario.</p>
      <h2>End of Project:</h2>
      <p>Throughout this assessment our group was able to keep to our agreed upon communication methods consistently, holding to our agreement of meeting twice a week, as well as meeting in person during our tutorial sessions even when the tutorial was no longer held in person. This proved to be quite effective at keeping us all on top of what tasks were required of us as well as allowing us to request help if needed. Thankfully our contingencies that we created after assessment 2 were not required regarding communication issues, as all members were consistently able to attend meetings, and were proactive in informing the group via text if they were unable to attend. Teams continued to prove effective as a messaging and meeting environment, and we began to make use of Trello as well in order to keep track of work progress more easily. Trello added an extra useful layer to our communication that proved to be quite useful, as it automatically notified the group when a task’s status was changed and had an easy-to-use visual system of task allocation, that worked well in conjunction to our table.</p>
