    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>Plans:</h1>
      <h2>Brief History of the Project</h2>
      <p>Initially the project idea came from Henry Norman’s assignment 1, which was an outline of an AR map that would allow RMIT students and staff to navigate around the RMIT buildings. The motivation for Henry to decide this project was that he felt that he saw a lot of RMIT students become lost when navigating around RMIT. Because of this reason MARPS was born. When deciding in assignment 2 for which project should be continued, we came up with 2 main ideas, one which was the AR map and the other being a music marketplace. Due to the amount of research already done and general group interest the AR map was chosen to be continued. Since assignment 1, the progress of MARPS has dramatically picked up in pace. During assignment 2 general research was done into what technologies could be used to create a functional program that would meet the project goals. Large decisions were made when selecting the right program to use as there was a wide range available. ARWAY was selected to be used as it provided a set of tools that are easy to use that other program did not offer. Now in assignment 3 the tools which will/have been used are in finalisation and the product is well on its way. There was a decision that was made in assignment 3 that slightly altered the goal of the project, The goal was shifted from directing a user from ground floor to building 08/8/82 to just navigating within room 82. This decision was made due to time constraints and workloads. At the current moment 18/05/2022 we are in step 2 of the Overarching aim. A more detailed breakdown of the progress and plan is below.</p>

      <h2>Plan Summary:</h2>
      <p>The initial stage of the project took place during previous assessments, being the initial research requirements into augmented reality and other related technologies. From this research, we were then able to make decisions on what programs would be used, with us settling on a combination of ARWAY and Unity as our primary tools. This then leads us into assessment 3, where the bulk of the production work will take place. Once assessment 3 has begun, the work on producing an initial prototype will begin after an initial week of report writing and researching, in order to give us more time to focus purely on the artifact production element. Once this has begun, the first step is to take a scan of an area, likely our tutorial room and surrounding hallways, as an initial test area. Whilst this is happening, a mock-up of the app's design will also be taking place, using Figma or a similar tool. The results of the scan will then be imported into Unity, to be made into an object suitable for our purposes. This object can then be exported into our prototype app, allowing us to create and test the user interface and pathfinding functions. This prototype is to be tested on our phones, in order to fine tune it for actual use and marking once handed in for this assessment.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What we plan for our project to do:</h2>
      <p>Our overall aim for this project is to create a pathfinding application that will act as an internal map for buildings, to aid people with finding their desired rooms within larger buildings, such as RMIT’s buildings. Our immediate aim is to achieve this for a specific part of one RMIT building, as proof of concept and to ensure our program works before expanding to cover a larger area. We decided to focus on this initial portion to allow us to make full use of our given timeframe to create as high quality of a prototype as we can, rather than cover a larger scope with a much rougher application. Using this initial aim, we have decided on several criteria to complete for us to deem the prototype a success, those being the display of a pathway to a specific room (08.08.82 of RMIT) from various points within a set area, the application itself being easy to understand and use, the application notifying users of potential obstacles along the way such as maintenance, and a way to show emergency escape routes from the user’s location. These criteria were picked for a couple of reasons, being that these features are all implementable within our chosen area, and that they are all relevant features for the broader application once the scope is expanded.  </p>

      <h2>How we plan to do it:</h2>
      <p>The initial plan to achieve these goals is to use ARWAY and Unity to create and visualise a map for the user. ARWAY works by taking a scan of an area through a camera and generating key points within the scanned structure. Once we have a scan of an area within building 8 of RMIT, we can then import this scan into Unity in order to visualise it and map the area out for the user. This 3d map will then be shown to the user through the application. The application end of the prototype will be created using Unity, in order to create a user interface with various functions.</p>
      <p>ARWAY makes use of a mapping application to create point cloud maps that are then stored on their cloud servers. The map is created by marking key points and features of the area being mapped, with a larger number of objects and distinct features being marked resulting in a more detailed and useful map. This point cloud data can then be imported into their web studio. This allows developers to flesh out the map with objects, floorplans and other assets to create a full 3D environment. If multiple point cloud maps are created for one area, they can also be arranged in their proper layout in this studio as well. Additionally, maps can be updated live from this studio, even while users are connected to them. This will allow for live troubleshooting and bug fixing. From here, a user can connect to these maps through our application, which will use the data from their camera feed to determine their location and direction within the mapped area. Our application will then display a pathway along the ground for the user to follow towards their input destination.</p>
      <p>Unity serves as a game engine and tool to create online environments, applications and assets if needed. ARWAY provides an SDK (software development kit) that can be imported into Unity as a package, allowing us to work with environments and maps for navigation and localisation. Unity will allow us to create 3D objects to match our point cloud maps, such as creating 3D rooms, furniture and other key features within the map. These can then be saved as .GLB files to be imported into ARWAY’s web suite and used to create a full 3D environment.</p>
