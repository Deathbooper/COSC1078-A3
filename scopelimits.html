    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>Scope and Limits:</h1>
      <h2>The scope of this project will include at least:</h2>
      <p>An app that can function as a camera and scan the area around it to create a virtual space that can be accessed by separate programs to modify the camera's output based upon the input. An example would be to take a live picture, have the phone take measurements from the camera to the walls, floor and ceiling of the room using something like LIDAR, and to change the picture output of the camera to something else based off the input that the phone is receiving, not just sticking some random picture on the screen every time a scan is done.</p>
      <p>The alterations of the camera output should be focused on navigation to a specific point, either pre-determined or found through user input. This alteration should come in the form of an arrow, line or something similar leading the user on a feasible path from the starting point to the destination in a single room.</p>
      <p>The app / program should be at least somewhat usable, perhaps not perfectly clean and polished, but it should be useable without herculean levels of excise tax used to figure it out.</p>
      <h2>The scope of this project could include:</h2>
      <p>Compatibility with more than a single room, this could go up to the whole of RMIT, or perhaps other buildings / places as well.</p>
      <p>A clean and intuitive look and flow of the app / program, so that all but the technologically illiterate would be able to pick it up and, using already learnt tech-literacy as to use as little excise as possible, be use it for the first time with little hassle.</p>
      <p>A feature that includes a line for emergency exits, this would be an option the user could select that would navigate them from wherever they are to the nearest emergency exit or emergency gathering location. This would be from the user's position to the nearest set destination (the emergency exit / gathering point.)</p>
      <p>A feature that includes pathways for the mobility impaired, such as people with wheelchairs. This would be a line very similar to the regular, however depending on the terrain may select a longer, but more accessible path that allows for wheelchair (or something similar) access. Think of it as instead of travelling 50 meters by taking the stairs to the destination, take the 100-meter path that uses an elevator for vertical travel to reach the destination.</p>
      <h2>The scope of this project will not include:</h2>
      <p>A feature that includes structural dangers in the building, or perhaps warnings of potential hazards. Dangers and hazards like slippery floors all the way up to rooms that cannot be exited or potential lethal hazards.</p>
