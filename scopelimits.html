    <h1>Detailed Description - IT Project - MARPS</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>Aims:</h1>
      <p>The goal: The goal for MARPS is to be able to direct RMIT users from building 8/08 elevator to room 82.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Overarching aim:</h2>
      <p>The aim for the creation of MARPS is to be able to direct a user around a room using AR technology on a phone. MARPS will show the user a line on their screen using their camera to direct them around the room to different pre-selected points. It Shall also inform the user of and present dangers. The result will be a completed prototype that proves the concept of a full-scale AR map for the internal of buildings. In order to achieve the successful completion of MARPS there has to be aims set, they are as follows:</p>
      <li><p>The first sub-aim is to complete research into different tools and technologies that are readily available that will allow for the map to be produced and created. Thorough research will have to be done here to ensure that the project will succeed. Without this step the project will never be able to get off the ground. A backup plan has been put in place for if this step is completed but no program can be found that will allow us to produce what we are looking for. (Backup plan 1.1)</p></li>
      <li><p>The second sub-aim is to take the technology that has been decided and found and to implement it to an experiment, the experiment will be to scan a small area and test to see if the program will work. Through doing this it will teach us how to use the program and how it reacts to the physical environment, and in return it will allow for a higher quality product to be produced. Should the aim of this step fail to be completed backup plan 1.2 will be implemented.</p></li>
      <li><p>The third sub-aim is to then start the production of MARPS, a scan will be done of the area and will be completed and uploaded to ARWAY. The aim will be to have an online environment that is the same scale as the physical environment. Should a problem occur with this step backup plan 1.3 will be implemented.</p></li>
      <li><p>The fourth sub-aim is to transfer the scanned data into unity and mockup the environment. This aim will be to create the online environment that the user will not see. A detailed breakdown for how this will be done can be found in the plans/progress section. This step is one of the most important steps out of all of them due to it being a critical step to mapping the scannable area. Should this step fail final backup plan will be implemented.</p></li>
      <li><p>The fifth sub-aim is to reupload the environment from unity into ARWAY and start production on the interface to select points of interest. This step is what the user will see, more details on this will be located in the plans and progress section. The importance of this aim is so that the users will have something to be able to click on to navigate. Should this step fail Final backup plan will be implemented.</p></li>
      <li><p>The sixth sub-aim is to finalize MARPS and test to ensure the product will work. This is the most crucial step in the production process as it is important that the product will complete the goal that was set, the goals for a successful product can be seen below. If this step fails Final backup plan will be implemented. </p></li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Finished product goals:</h2>
      <li><p>Display the path on a phone screen using the camera to navigate around a room.</p></li>
      <li><p>Be easy to understand and use for new users</p></li>
      <li><p>Successfully arrive at the user specified location within the room</p></li>
      <li><p>Show structural dangers whilst navigating through the room</p></li>
      <li><p>Show an emergency escape route to leave the room</p></li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Backup plan 1.1:</h2>
      <p>Should the plan fail to find an application that will allow us to produce an AR map that is of a high standard, we will just create a proof of concept mockup, steps 2,4 and 5 will be skipped and will move straight onto step 6. Should this backup plan fail to be achieved then the project will skimpily not be made up. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Backup plan 1.2:</h2>
      <p>Should we fail to be able to test the program we will seek help from experienced users of the product. This will allow us to better understand the program. Alternatively, if no help can be found we will move back to step 1 and find a new program that could be used. Should this fail backup plan 1.1 will be implemented.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Backup plan 1.3:</h2>
      <p>Should we fail to be able to scan the physical environment, we will try to find another application that can do it for us, or we will physically make the outline on unity and then re upload it to the program. Should any other errors occur we will attempt to seek help from experts to try and solve the problem or we will move onto a figma mockup similar to backup plan 1.1.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Final backup plan:</h2>
      <p>The final backup plan is if everything is not going to plan and we are running out of time we will focus all of our attention to the figma mockup. This will allow us to have an artifact to present when presentations come up. </p>
