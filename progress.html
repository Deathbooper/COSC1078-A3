      <h2>Pre-Assignment 3:</h2>
      <h2>Week 1:</h2>
      <p>This first week was comprised of task allocation, planning and report writing. We decided during the first meeting that getting the report mostly complete within the first two weeks would be optimal and allow us a larger amount of time to create prototypes and perform testing, whilst also creating the website aspect of the assessment. The specific elements of the report that were completed during this first week were the group processes, group processes and communication, tools and overview. This served as a good foundation for the report, as we analysed the methods in which our group both had and would communicate, as well as outlined our project overview and created a list of initial tools that we planned to use. Additionally, we created our group Trello board during this week and sorted out how we would use it, as well as began the notation of our meeting agendas and actions.</p>
      <h2>Week 2:</h2>
      <p>The second week was similar to our first week, as it mostly consisted of completing the report elements of the assessment. We completed most of the longer elements of the report, mainly the career and ideal jobs section, the scope and limits of the project, project description and risks. Additionally, more content was added to group processes and communications, and tools. We also began some of the initial project creation and testing, trying out methods of creating floor plans. We planned to find a method of creating floorplans to work together with the ARWAY mapping application, as physically measuring and drawing the floorplan by hand would take too long. Several applications were tested, these being Roomscan, LiDAR, Roomscan Pro, Polycam LiDAR and 3D Scanner, but these proved ineffective as they all requested a monthly subscription. As our budget for the project was $0, these were off the table.</p>
      <h2>Week 3:</h2>
      <p>With the majority of the report completed by this week, we began to create the project artifacts and prototypes in earnest. This week we unfortunately discovered that ARWAY’s mapping application had been taken down of the app store, with no reason given in their documentation. This left us in an inconvenient spot, as we now had to find a way to create maps using ARWAY’s web suite, without the use of their point cloud mapping. However, we had found an application to create floorplans that did not require a subscription or any payment, that also was able to create 3D objects from floorplans as well as add assets such as furniture and key features. This would not only result in saving us time in Unity, but also gave us a potential way to create maps without the point cloud mapping. We now had to learn how to use ARWAY’s web suite to fill in some of the features manually, which proved to be time consuming as their documentation is not the clearest when it comes to product use.</p>
      <p>The final elements of the report that were completed this week were team roles, plans, current progress and aims. Additionally, the skills and jobs section was completed, though several group members had to step in to complete this section. Our website and repository were created this week, as we now had enough of the report completed to begin transferring content over to it. Finally, as we now had a way to create usable floorplans and assets for use with ARWAY, we used magic plan to create two floorplans, a floorplan of one member’s home for initial testing purposes, and once we were able to meet at our tutorial room, a floorplan of 08.08.82 of RMIT and the surrounding areas. This gave us an initial area to map out and create navigation to suit our current scope.</p>
      <h2>Week 4:</h2>
      <p>With our final week we primarily worked on technical elements of the project as well as editing and putting together the final report. Figma was used to create wireframes and a mockup of our application, and ARWAY’s web suite was used to create functional floorplans. A lot of time was spent during this week learning and researching how to make use of the remaining ARWAY developer tools, now that they had removed their mapping application, which a lot of their functionality had relied upon. Eventually we learnt how to add the required navigational features to our floorplans and models, though this is only theoretically achieved for now as we have not yet tested it through accessing the map with a functional app. Additionally, we also spent time researching the use of their Unity SDK and its uses, and how to use this to create and work with the other ARWAY tools.</p>

      <h2>Changes Made:</h2>
      <p>Week1:</p>  
      <p>A large change was decided during this week. This change was to adjust the goal of the project to not direct a user from the ground floor to room 08/8/82 but instead to direct a user around room 82 and if we have extra time allow for the user to be directed from the elevator on level 8 to the room. This change was decided due to time constraints and workload constraints.</p> 
      <p>A minor change was made during this week to better reflect workloads, this change was the creation of a Trello board that allowed for a better visualization of completed work</p> 
      <p>The changes that were made during this week were necessary to create a more achievable outcome for the project. In reflection these choices were the most applicable ones that could have been made to ensure fairness and maximum efficiency.</p>
      <p>Week 3:</p>
      <p>Due to ARWAY taking down their mapping app we needed another way to create maps. We began looking into using their web suite within the developer portal. 3D objects and floor plans are instead now being created using magic plan to then be uploaded into the web suite, though this is not a feasible solution for a full-scale product.</p>
      <p>Week 4:</p>
      <p>As magic plan is now being used to create floorplans, Unity is not needed as much to create assets, as magic plan comes with the ability to turn floorplans into 3D objects, add assets like furniture, and stitch multiple room scans together.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
      <p>Week 1:</p>
      <p>During this week we faced the challenge of ensuring that group members would achieve the work that they had been set. The issue that had arisen from assignment 2 regarding contribution was resolved during this week.</p>
      <p>Week 2:</p>
      <p>During this week Ryan completed the work that the rest of the team asked him to do, meaning that he was going to stay on the team. However, this resulted in a reallocation of work for all the other team members, tasking everyone with another work delegation phase before we could really start getting some work done.</p>
      <p>Week 3:</p>
      <p>During this week we found that ARWAY had taken down their mapping app and had replaced it with a web suite for map creation instead. This web suite is much more complex to use than their previous mapping application and it is not particularly clear how to use its features. This week also saw a pressing concern regarding work that had been completed by Shiou Ping, Anthony was consulted, and the issues were resolved to a satisfactory extent.</p>
      <p>Week 4:</p>
      <p>Learning how to use ARWAY as well as its integration with Unity proved to take more time than expected, so creating a functional map with the required navigation tools and waypoints took some time. Once the map was believed to be functional, we were still unable to test it as we did not have a functional app to connect to the map and navigate with it.</p>
