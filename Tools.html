  <h2>GitHub Work Representation</h2>
  <p>Our teams audit trail on the Git repository does not really reflect our groups work at all. The overwhelming majority of our teams work was done on Microsoft teams word docs where it was all automatically saved to the cloud and we could all have easy access to it. Teams was also the obvious choice as we held recordings on it and also had the recorded meetings along with the transcripts already on teams. There is no audit trail for teams however there is a last updated function which we did find useful to track who and when was editing certain files. As there is no Git repository audit trail for the previous mentioned reasons, it cannot be used as a reflection for the groups work. Microsoft Teams provided the superior alternative in this case. A Git repository audit trail can still be seen though, it was created when we were creating the website for the report and this can be seen, however there is not much to reflect on.</p>
